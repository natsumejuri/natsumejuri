The town inside me and everyone's voice  
Only I'm not there, just watching from afar  
I can't go home because I'm afraid  
Something will change, me without me  
I'm the one to blame  
I've moved on, by my own will  
(I had nothing else I wanted to do)  
It wasn't hard, but I didn't hate it  
(I did not even like it)  
I've been patient, but it was bearable  
I've had a gray haze for a long time though (boom-boom)  
I never found out, what it was, I  
It's my stress, that's for sure  
I never wanted to run away  
(I was vÐµry motivated)  
Then what is this feeling?  
(Who would I ask?)  
I've been patiÐµnt, but it was bearable  
I've had a gray haze for a long time though (boom-boom)  
I never found out, what it was, I  
Tastes like vegetables I don't like  
The town inside me and everyone's voice  
Only I'm not there, just watching from afar  
I can't go home because I'm afraid  
Something will change, me without me  
I'm the one to blame  
I'm not waiting (for a Santa Claus)  
I already have the gifts, just can't open the box  
(Just can't open the box)  
I know all about it, no one can stop it  
Unless I just had to do something 'bout it  
"It's not even a case!"  
I've been patient, but it was bearable  
I've had a gray haze for a long time though (boom-boom)  
I never found out, what it was, I  
I hate the alarm clock I chose  
The town inside me and everyone's voice  
Only I'm not there, just watching from afar  
I can't go home because I'm afraid  
Something will change, me without me  
I'm the one to blame  
I'm out of patience, my body is light  
Let's paint the gray haze into sky blue  
I know who you are!  
I'm not leaving you again!  
The town inside me and everyone's voice  
Only I'm not there, just watching from afar  
There is no where to go back, nowhere to go  
It's all just food y'know  
Be without me (I'm the one to blame)  
The night falls, the place where I belong  
No matter what changes, will no longer change me  
No matter what (change), no, no, no, won't change me  
I can feel the light, even after the sun goes down
