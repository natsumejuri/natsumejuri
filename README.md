The town inside me and everyone's voice  
Only I'm not there, just watching from afar  
I can't go home because I'm afraid  
Something will change, me without me  
I'm the one to blame  
I'm out of patience, my body is light  
Let's paint the gray haze into sky blue  
I know who you are!  
I'm not leaving you again!  
The town inside me and everyone's voice  
Only I'm not there, just watching from afar  
There is no where to go back, nowhere to go  
It's all just food y'know  
Be without me (I'm the one to blame)  
The night falls, the place where I belong  
No matter what changes, will no longer change me  
No matter what (change), no, no, no, won't change me  
I can feel the light, even after the sun goes down
